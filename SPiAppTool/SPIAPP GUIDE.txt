About:
######

Call of Duty 4 SPi Tools is a new COD4 App that makes singleplayer mission developing way easier.
It adds lots of shortcuts, and it makes the whole mission developing process so much easier.
The app is based on the original COMPILE TOOLS with many more things added to it, 
so we can say that it is an extended compile tools app.
Also the app is designed to serve mainly singleplayer map making.
It is not tested with multiplayer map making 
so I can not promise it won't have problems with MP.

The idea, the design and the abilities of the software are instructed by SPi
The software programming and developing is done by Scillman.

Installation:
#############

1) The SPiApp can work in it's own directory.
you can simply paste the SPiApp2 folder where you want it to be "installed"
I have it on my Call of Duty 4 Game directory to keep things compact.

2) Open SPiApp folder and make shortcuts of SPiApp2.exe

3) You're ready to start! Just like that!

How to Use:
###########

Please read this part carefully so you know how to use these tools properly without problems.

IMPORTANT:
YOU NEED THE OFFICIAL CALL OF DUTY 4 MOD TOOLS INSTALLED FOR THIS APP TO WORK!

I have made some Basic Mission Setup Tutorials (without this app)
That you should definitely check out to have some standards in mind when you work on cod4.
Here's the playlist:

First of all, there are 4 Tabs on top. We'll go through them one by one.

==============
1) PREFERENCES
==============

Here you must set the path of some essential folders and files for the tools to work properly.

First Tab: Required. 
Set your Call of Duty 4 game folder there, then your language, and then the 7za.exe file.
7za.exe is probably located in call of duty 4/bin folder that comes with the official COD4 Mod Tools.
If it's not then you probably have to get it somehow. I am not authorized to provide it to you.
When you are done setting the paths, don't forget to press SAVE CHANGES to apply them.
If you don't they may not be saved if you close the app.

Second Tab: Advanced.
Singleplayer executable should be: iw3sp.exe in most cases.
Chose a Text editor software with which your map's gsc, str and csv files will open through our App.
The rest settings here are not so important.
Don't forget to press SAVE CHANGES again.

Third Tab: Optional.
Here, you can set some custom folder shortcuts.
Text is button name, destination is the path of the folder.

=================================
2) COMPILING
=================================

This is where all the magic happens.
Here you can easily create missions and browse through the necessary files.

======== PART A: CREATING THE MISSION. =============

On the TOP LEFT corner of the app you can see NEW MAP and REFRESH

NEW MAP is a very special button I came up with.
By clicking on it you're asked to select a template to generate a new map.
Template files are in the template folder in the app's directory.
You can make your own templates by following the instructions there.
For now there are only two working template: SPi_testmap and survival_basic.
We will go with Basic Map(SPi) for the first test.
Type a valid map_name for your new level and click Create Map.
Then, the app will generate a new map with the name you entered, based on the template files.
All you have to do to play the map is to complete all compile steps.

REFRESH just refreshes the map list in case you created a new one while the app is open so it appears on the list.
Exactly like original Compile Tools.

============= PART B: COMPILING =============

When you have a map from the Map List selected,
you can directly open the map in radiant by pressing the Radiant button on top-middle-left.
There's a "Load Selected Map in Radiant" button that you can use to open the selected map 
from the Map List when you start Radiant from this shortcut. Pretty handy right?
You can use the shortcuts on the middle-right side of the tab to access the selected map's scripts.
This way, after generating a new map through the basic templates, 
you can expand and make your own missions by editing the files of the newly generated map.

On the Far-Left under the Map List you can see the 5 compile buttons just like original Compile Tools.
They work exactly the same. Make sure to have proper options on the BSP and LIGHT options when compiling.
BSP options should all be unchecked.
LIGHT options should be fast, verbose, model shadow for TESTING
and just extra when final RELEASE.
It's not recommended that you mess with the rest, 
unless you know what you are doing.

Having all this in mind, we click New Map, 
we select the spi_testmap template,
we put a valid name let's say: my_test1
we click create map,
we check fast, verbose and model shadow in light options, and unchedk extra if its checked.
we make sure Compile BSP, Lighting and Paths are all checked,
we press Compile BSP,
we wait for it to finish,
we press Compile Reflections,
we wait for it to finish,
we press Build Fast File,
we wait for it to finish,
and finally, we press Run Selected Map to play our new basic Singleplayer map.

Given that the template you chose is not having things missing, it will run without errors.

Now that you know the map is working, you are ready to start expanding your map.
Click the Radiant Button to open the selected map and edit it any way you want,
or click on the script shortcuts for the selected map to start scripting your own mission events.
Good Luck!

Friendly ERROR Advise:
If you are new to this, you will come across errors when doing new scripting stuff in your maps.
Errors are and always will be natural when humans do scripting, coding and programming.
There is ALWAYS something we missed or something wrong with the files we made.
Sometimes it's the engine itself, but most times it's a human error. 

Keep developer on and check the game's console when errors pop up.

Game breaking errors will throw you out of the map back to menu when you press escape.
Less important errors will just pop an error screen as you play the map and resume the mission when you press escape.
Worst kind of errors are the ones that crash the game without warning.

============= PART C: MOD DEVELOPING =============

When making missions that do not have any custom assets, 
like new textures, new sounds and stuff like that,
you do NOT need a mod. It is recommended to stay this way.

But if you want a more advanced and richer map with modded assets,
then a mod is a must for your map.

While on the Compiling Tab, on the whole right side of the app
we can see Mod Compiling options.
Here we can find buttons like New Mod and Refresh
that work similar to the Level compiling ones,
below them we can find a list of the mod folders that are in the game's mod folder.
And below that we can see various mod making buttons.

Browse Folder opens the folder of the selected mod in the mod list.
Build Fast File, Build IWD File and Update Zone File of the mod part,
aren't fully working so I suggest not messing with them.
I haven't used this app to create mods. I do it an other way.
Scillman added these buttons to the app for advanced users.
I haven't explored the app's mod creating abilities in depth 
so I can not give any guidance or advise.
If you have no idea how it works, I suggest not touching it.
For further info, ask Scillman.

However you can just use this list to start up mods easier.
Below the Run Selected Mod button we can find launch options for the mod.
Start game with the mod in Singleplayer or Multiplayer.
Developer mode, Developer Script, Cheats, and load selected map when launching the modded game.
These can be pretty handy.

============= PART D: SHORTCUTS =============

Middle-Top Mod tool shortcut buttons:
1) We only talked about the Radiant button which can just open without a map if the checkbox isn't checked,
or it can open with the selected map from the map list loaded if the checkbox is checked.
2) Assets Manager opens Assets Manager.
3) Effects Editor opens Effects Editor.

Middle-Bottom Custom Shortcuts.
We talked about those in the Preferences>Optional tab.
You can set your own folder shortcuts here.

Middle-Right and lower 
Folder Browsing:
Six very significant folders of cod4/raw directory that are often used
when making singleplayer levels or mods. Very handy in many cases.

===========
3) BROWSING
===========

Browsing is the simplest tab there is.
It just adds useful folder shortcuts from the game and mod tools folders that you may need.
It's a lot better than browsing the game directory to find one single file.
Some of them are already in the previous tab for faster navigation.

===============
4) APPLICATIONS
===============

This Tab is similar to the Compile Tools' Applications Tab.
You have Radiant, Assets manager, Effects Editor and Run Converter
with the same descriptions.
Only one change is done for users safety.
When you click Run Converter it will ask for confirmation.

Run Converter should only be ran once when the tools are installed
and when you have no work done in the game.

Never ever ever run it again after you've done work because it will most likely mess things up.
Careful with that.

=================================

OUTRO:
That's all there is. I hope I explained everything you needed 
and I also hope that you find this tool extremely helpful in your mapping experience.

If you hesitate using the tool because you don't trust it, I totally understand it.
But I myself use this app non-stop since December of 2018 and I never had problems with them.
On the contrary they made my life so much easier when working with COD4 mod tools.
Scillman who programmed this app should even have the source code somewhere.
He may show it to you if you ask him.

For any further questions you can ask me(SPi) or Scillman.
Good Luck!
